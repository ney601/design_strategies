# Design Strategies

### 1. What do we mean by coupling and cohesion when discussing structured design?

Coupling describes the level of interdependence present between software modules. Low coupling refers to when modules are independent and therefore chsnges in one modules will have little impact on other modules. Whereas high coupling refers to when modules are strongly interdependent or closely connected and therefore will greatly impact other modules when changes are made in one module.

Choesion describes the level to which elements within a module are related to each other and work to serve a single purpose. Low cohesion means that the elements are loosely related and therefore serve multiple purposes. High cohesion means that the elements are closely related and therefore serve a single purpose.

### 2. What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up design? Which best describes a function oriented design?



### 3. In which design methodology would a class diagram be most useful?

### 4. What are the four pillars of object oriented programming? Give a single-sentence description of each.

### 5. What is the strategy pattern? How would its implementation differ between a functional and object oriented system?

### 6. Imagine your is creating a new online payment system. In order to gain maximum market share it can't be tied to a particular sector - it needs to work just as well when ordering a takeaway as when buying a new coat. Which design methodology would you suggest following? Give some justification for your decision.
